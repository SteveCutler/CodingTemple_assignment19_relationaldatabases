First Normal Form:
My database design adheres to first normal form for several reasons. Each table describes one type of data, 
each column describes one entity, and each row in the table describes one atomic part of that entity.

Second Normal Form:
Every data type is dependent on a primary key.

Third Normal Form:
The primary key defines all non-key columns. The publisher ID makes sure that the diagram follows third normal form. By linking 
a publisher id to each book, and the publisher id completely describing each publisher I have made the chart follow third normal form.
