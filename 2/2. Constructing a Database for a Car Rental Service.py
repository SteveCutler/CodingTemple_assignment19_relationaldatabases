# Objective:
# The aim of this assignment is to design a relational database for "AutoRent," a car 
# rental service, with a specific focus on implementing one-to-one relationships to
# efficiently manage vehicle and rental agreement details.

# Problem Statement:
# "AutoRent" requires a robust database system to streamline its vehicle management and 
# rental agreements. Each vehicle in their fleet is associated with exactly one rental 
# agreement at any given time, and each rental agreement corresponds to one unique vehicle, 
# illustrating a one-to-one relationship. The current system lacks this precise linkage, 
# leading to operational inefficiencies.


# Task 1: Database Schema Design

# Develop a detailed schema for "AutoRent" focusing on Vehicles and Rental_Agreements.
# Include necessary columns in each table with appropriate data types and constraints.
# Ensure your design reflects a one-to-one relationship between Vehicles and Rental_Agreements.
# Expected Outcome:
# A clearly defined database schema highlighting tables, columns, data types, primary keys, and 
# foreign keys, emphasizing the one-to-one relationship.

# Task 2: Creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

# Construct an ERD that visually represents the one-to-one relationship between Vehicles and Rental_Agreements.
# Use standard ERD notation to clearly indicate the nature of the relationship.
# Expected Outcome:
# An informative ERD showing a one-to-one relationship, with Vehicles linked to Rental_Agreements through unique identifiers.

# Task 3: Addressing Unique Constraints and Data Integrity

# In your schema, ensure that the one-to-one relationship maintains data integrity and respects unique constraints.
# Modify the ERD if necessary to reflect any additional constraints or keys used to enforce the one-to-one relationship.
# Expected Outcome:
# A revised schema and ERD that effectively enforce a one-to-one relationship with proper constraints, ensuring data integrity.

# Task 4: Scenario Analysis

# Analyze and describe how the one-to-one relationship between Vehicles and Rental_Agreements 
# will handle scenarios such as new vehicle additions, rental agreement updates, and vehicle availability checks.
# Expected Outcome:
# A detailed analysis of various operational scenarios and how the database design accommodates 
# these situations, leveraging the one-to-one relationship.
