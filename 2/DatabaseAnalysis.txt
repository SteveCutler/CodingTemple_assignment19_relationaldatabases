The one-to-one relationship between vehicles and rental agreements allows for flexible management and updating
of the car rental stock and rental agreements. New vehicle additions simply involve populating the Vehicles table, updates to rental 
agreements can be performed as long as the integrity of the one-to-one relationship is maintained 
(one vehicle unique vehicle id for each unique rental agreement), and vehicle availability checks 
 are simple to perform by checking the connection between these two tables.
